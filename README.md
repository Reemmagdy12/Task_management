Task Management API

Overview

Task Management API is a backend service built with Django and Django REST Framework (DRF) to manage tasks effectively. It provides endpoints for user authentication, task creation, updates, deletion, and filtering. Each user can manage their own tasks without accessing others' data, ensuring privacy and security.

Features

User Management:

User registration, login, and secure authentication (JWT).

Each user has a unique username, email, and password.


Task Management:

Create, read, update, and delete tasks.

Task attributes include Title, Description, Due Date, Priority Level (Low, Medium, High), and Status (Pending, Completed).

Mark tasks as complete or incomplete, with a timestamp for completion.

Validation for due dates and priority levels.


Task Filters and Sorting:

Filter tasks by status, priority level, and due date.

Sort tasks by due date or priority.


Access Control:

Users can only manage their own tasks.

Permission checks to prevent unauthorized access.
